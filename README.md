# Impact_Evaluation

## Executive Summary
This project leveraged the Reality Check (RC) data to analyse how different concerns and attitudes, such as long-term optimism, influence different consumer mindsets in the current socio-economic climate. By identifying key drivers for mindsets like "Confident" and "Resentful," the analysis offers actionable insights that can improve targeted marketing strategies for clients. The potential impact on client revenue is significant, with estimated gains of up to Â£20 million across 20 clients. While the study faced limitations such as class imbalance, it provides a strong foundation for future, more sophisticated analyses.

## Introduction
The RC data began as a COVID-19 tracker in March 2020. However, by 2023, it had evolved into a UK-wide segmentation survey that groups people based on their resilience levels and how the cost-of-living crisis has impacted their attitudes and behaviours. The sharp rise in inflation in 2022 triggered this crisis, leading to significant shifts in spending habits, with 86% of UK adults expressing concern about their daily living costs.(1,2) The RC survey consists of six mindsets or segments: Surviving, Frustrated, Resentful, Coping, Carefree and Confident. Currently, RC is a quarterly tracker, and this project focuses on data from Q2 2024. An earlier analysis of the Q3 2023 RC data did not explore these mindsets in detail. This project aims to build upon the previous work by delving deeper into the mindsets and the factors that drive them. By gaining a clearer understanding of these segments, the media agency can better assist clients in refining their marketing strategies and improving business key performance indicators (KPIs).

## Methodology
### Hypothesis
H0: There is no statistically significant relationship between different mindsets and various concerns and attitudes.
H1: There is at least one statistically significant relationship between mindsets and various concerns and attitudes.
In this context, the concerns and attitudes refer to a wide range factors, such as long-term optimism, worries about economic conditions, personal and financial wellbeing, social issues, and more specific anxieties (e.g., artificial intelligence).
